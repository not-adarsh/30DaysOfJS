# 30 days of JS

## Day 1 - 13/07/2024

### Variables and Data Types

- There are three different ways to define variables in JS
  - var : older method of defining the variables in JS, the problem with variables was that it doesn't implemented the scopes
  - let : modern method of implementing the values that will change
  - const : as name says constant values
- Understand the different data types in JavaScript:
  - Number: Numeric values e.g., `18`
  - String: Textual data e.g., `"ady"`
  - Boolean: True or false values e.g., `true`
  - Object: Collection of key-value pairs e.g.,
  ```js
  {
      username: "adyLovesCoding",
      password: "JSisðŸ’–",
  }
  ```
  - Array: Ordered list of values e.g.,
  ```js
  ["mon", "sun", "thurs"];
  ```

### Tasks

#### Variable Declaration

- Task 1: Declare a variable using var, assign it a number, and log the value to the console âœ…
- Task 2: Declare a variable using let, assign it a string, and log the value to the console âœ…

```js
var num = 12
console.log(num)
let name = "ady
console.log(name)
```

#### Constant Declaration

- Task 3: Declare a variable using const, assign it a boolean value, and log the value to the console âœ…

```js
const isLoggedIn = false;
console.log(isLoggedIn);
```

#### Data Types

- Task 4: Create variables of different data types (number, string, boolean, object, array) and log each variable's type using the typeof operator âœ…

```js
let name = "ady";
let age = 18;
let isAdult = true;
let loginData = {
  username: "adyLovesCoding",
  password: "JSisðŸ’–",
};
let lastLoginTime = ["mon", "sun", "thurs"];
console.log(typeof name);
console.log(typeof age);
console.log(typeof isAdult);
console.log(typeof loginData);
console.log(typeof lastLoginTime);
```

#### Reassigning Variables

- Task 5: Declare a variable using let, assign it an initial value, reassign a new value, and log both values to the console âœ…

```js
let name = "ady";
console.log(name);
name = "adarsh";
console.log(name);
```

#### Understanding const

Task 6: Try reassigning a variable declared with const and observe the error âœ…

```js
const pi = 3.14;
pi = 9.97;
```

```bash
pi = 9.96
   ^

TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

```

### Feature Request

- Variable Types Console Log: Write a script that declares variables of different data types and logs both the value and type of each variable to the console âœ…

```js
let name = "ady";
let age = 18;
let isAdult = true;
let loginData = {
  username: "adyLovesCoding",
  password: "JSisðŸ’–",
};
let lastLoginTime = ["mon", "sun", "thurs"];
console.log(typeof name, name);
console.log(typeof age, age);
console.log(typeof isAdult, isAdult);
console.log(typeof loginData, loginData);
console.log(typeof lastLoginTime, lastLoginTime);
```

- Reassignment Demo: Create a script that demonstrates the difference in behavior between let and const when it comes to reassignmentâœ…

```js
let name = "ady";
name = "adarsh";
const pi = 3.14;
pi = 9.97;
```

```bash
pi = 9.96
   ^

TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

Node.js v22.4.0
```

- Know how to declare variables using var, let, and const.
- Understand the different data types in JavaScript.
- Be able to use the typeof operator to identify the data type of a variable.
